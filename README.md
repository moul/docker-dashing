# docker-smashing

Ship your [smashing](http://smashing.io/) as docker image!

The dockerfile uses the official [ruby:alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) base image to be extremly small.
The smashing process will be executed as smashing user, not as root.

Find this image on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/moul/smashing/).

Based on https://github.com/detached/docker-dashing

# Usage

Use this image as base for your smashing image.

Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your smashing project containing one simple line:

    FROM moul/smashing

Thats it!

Two `ON BUILD` hooks will add all your files to the image and execute `bundle` on your Gemfile.

# Build

Run `docker build -t mysmashing .` in your project folder.

# Run

To start your application run

    docker run -p 80:8080 mysmashing

To change the port smashing binds to, start the container with additional arguments:

    docker run -p 80:6666 mysmashing start -p 6666
